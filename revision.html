              <p>
                  COVID-19 has changed many lives and challenged our outlooks and
                  prospects. Sadly, many students may not have received the grades
                  they would have had if they were given the opportunity to sit the
                  exams in June.
              </p>
              <p>
                  At SLA, we have over 26 years of experience in
                  preparing students over a short period of time for examinations.
                  Our tutors are totally familiar with all the syllabuses and are
                  aware of the requirement for achieving high grades.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Our intensive week-long revision courses will take place online
                  with the students in the comfort and safety of their homes.
                  There will be scheduled live classes over Microsoft Teams.
                  Students will have their problem areas addressed in small groups,
                  their questions answered in a friendly and approachable manner
                  and there will be plenty of exam questions to practise with.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As teachers, we all faced the same hardships and uncertainty
                  as the students and are fully aware of the task ahead.  We will
                  be providing the means and the environment for students to
                  thrive and develop the much-needed self-confidence and ability
                  to answer exam questions so that they can finally reach their
                  true potential. We will teach the students the subject matter as
                  well as exam technique.  Students have been known to upgrade by
                  2 grades simply by altering their method of answering exam question.

              <p style="margin-bottom:3px;">
                  Our short course is aimed at GCSE students who want to retake their
                  GCSEs during the upcoming Autumn examinations and will catered to
                  individual needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We must emphasise that the course does not aim to go through every
                  inch of the syllabus as it will not be possible to do so in a short
                  space of time.  However, it aims to cover the problem areas of the
                  students who attend the class and prepare them for the examinations by
                  teaching them exam technique, time management and data analysis.

                  We do not apologise for calling this course what it really is.  We
                  are experts in preparing students for examinations in short spaces
                  of time such as Easter Revisions and this is one such revision. The
                  entire course is run online, using Microsoft Teams and involves
                  live classes with tutors who are simply the BEST in their field.  The
                  topics taught depends on the people on the course and their problem areas.
                  The course is made to measure to the needs of the students involved.

              <p>
                  We teach revision technique, exam technique and exam approach.  We cover
                  topics students have difficulty with, we help students learn data analysis
                  and we help them with answering exam questions.

              <p>
                  Our tutors are all subject specialists and highly experienced.  SLA is
                  indeed the Home to the Best Tutors.  Most tutors have had
                  their students achieved 100% in their exam papers and Dr Etessami has
                  had a student who scored 600/600 for Biology which is not a numerical
                  subject.   We all love what we do, and we all care for the students under
                  our care.  Allow us to help you achieve the best you are capable of.
