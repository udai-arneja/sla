                      At SLA,<a style="font-weight: bold;"> students come first</a> and are taught by some of the<a style="font-weight: bold;"> best tutors </a> in Britian.

                  <p>
                    We take our teaching very seriously - striving for every lesson taught to be <a style="font-weight: bold;">fun,
                    informative and thorough</a>. We aim to teach each student holistically in <a style="font-weight: bold;">small class sizes</a>
                    or in 1:1 sessions, addressing every aspect of our students'
                    education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      With us students learn how to organise their studies and learn
                      <i>‘how to learn’</i> first .  They are encouraged at all times to
                      <a style="font-weight: bold;"> question and understand concepts </a>
                      as opposed to memorise mindlessly.  This will help with the long-term
                      retention of the topics and encourage the student to pursue the
                      topic more vigorously.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      All of our students are taught the <a style="font-weight: bold;">application of knowledge </a>through
                      regular testing.  By providing detailed feedback to students, problem
                      areas are addressed.  There are a huge supply of resources and access
                      to past question papers that allows students to practise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We intend to teach each of our students a wide range of <a style="font-weight: bold;">high-level revision
                      techniques</a> such as time management, mind mapping and summary sheet
                      organisation. This will pave the way for them to achieve their full potential
                      in the external examinations, as well as equipping them with essential skills
                      for the future - inline with our vision at SLA.

                    It is a well known fact that Education in the UK is unparalleled
                    and that certifications from the UK are likely to be accepted by
                    all institutions around the world.
                </p>
                <img class="textwrapl" src="photos/about.png" width:"100%">
                <p>
                  With this fact established, I have a vision!  At SLA, I
                  want to be able to provide British education to as many willing
                  students as possible in as many corners of the world as possible.
                  With the available technology, pupils do not need to move away from
                  the warmth of their family & friends and the familiarity of their
                  native country.  Parents need not spend a great deal of money and
                  families need not split in order to give their children the best
                  start in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  COVID-19 has changed the way we operate and the way we approach things
                  in life.  This includes the education of our children.  There are many
                  students who are vulnerable and in the risk group.  There are students
                  who live with a member of the family who is at high risk.  For these
                  students, going back to school is a risk to life and it is unfair to
                  put pupils at such a crossroad without providing an alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are that alternative.  We provide full A level and re-take GCSEs online
                  with minimum contact for the science practicals, all while ensuring the highest
                  quality of education for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this in mind, I have got together under one 'cyber roof' some of the
                  best tutors UK has to offer.  Our tutors have the experience and the know-how
                  to help each and every individual student succeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We instill confidence and knowledge and help students pave the path to future careers.

                <p>
                  Professor Salk was inspirational to his students and a whole generation of
                  scientists and potential scientists.  His genius, vision and talent saw the
                  first vaccine for Polio to be developed, tested and implemented worldwide.
                  This put a stop to one of the biggest killers the world had seen.  We thought
                  it was appropriate for an educational institute starting in 2020 with the
                  Coronavirus pandemic raging around us to have the name of a brilliant scientist
                  that successfully combatted a comparably dangerous virus.  May this bring
                  inspiration to our students so that they realise all obstacles are surmountable
                  with perseverance, effort and hard work.

                      <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                          Jonas Edward Salk (28 October 1914-23 June 1995) was an American medic who decided to
                          become a virologist and medical researcher instead of a physician.  After initially
                          working on flu virus, he started research on different variants of poliovirus from
                          1948.  For the next 7 years he and his team devoted their efforts into developing a
                          vaccine for polio.  The field trial for the vaccine he developed was arguably one of
                          the most extensive and elaborate processes undertaken globally.  It involved 20,000
                          experts including physicians, 64,000 school personnel and 220,000 volunteers.
                          Ultimately, 1.8 million schoolchildren took part in the global trial.  Before the
                          introduction of the vaccine in 1955, polio was feared as much as the atomic bomb.
                          Post world wars, polio raged, killing thousands of people and paralysing many others.
                          In 1949, polio killed thousands but also left 1 in 1,000 children who had contracted it
                          with paralysis.  Although it killed fewer than the flu pandemic of 1918, its psychological
                          effect, seeing so many children paralysed was profound.  Even though there were no
                          lockdowns, people sensibly avoided public places and isolated themselves as much as was
                          possible.  World travel was very limited and the spread of the disease was limited.
                          At this time, “iron lungs” were invented to help prevent asphyxiation of the polio
                          patients and this was considered revolutionary method of treatment which reduced death
                          rates markedly.
                      </p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                        In the midst of all this, Salk and his team were busy trying to find an effective vaccine against
                        the virus.  Despite being funded privately, Salk decided not to patent the vaccine and not to seek
                        profit in order to ease its global use.  He was hailed as a miracle worker. In 1963 Salk founded
                        the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla California which is currently a centre for
                        medical & scientific research.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Salk considered vaccination of children against diseases a “moral obligation” of parents and society.
                        Since there is no known cure for any virus to date, vaccine seems the only defence against it.
                        There are many parallels to the present day.  Only that with the level of technology of today, we
                        hope, it will not take 7 years to develop an effective vaccine against Coronavirus.

                  We believe education is about showing the way to success to students so that
                  they can achieve their fullest potential.  This involves lighting up their path
                  and smoothing the potholes along the way.  It was chosen as part of our name
                  because we feel we are able to light up the ‘educational path’ of the students

                  We mean to show every student who studies with us the way to reach their potential

                  Avicenna:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Avicenna (980-1037) was chosen because he was inspirational to centuries of scientists
                  in the world and is respected and revered even today as a prominent scholar of his time
                  in par with Aristotle and Galan. Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) has been recognised
                  by both East & West, as one of the great figures in intellectual history.  He was an
                  all-round scientist delving in Psychology, Astronomy, Philosophy, Metaphysics, Physics,
                  Chemistry and Medicine. Avicenna refers to several ethical subjects which can be
                  characterised into three main areas of considering patient interests, communication
                  skills, and adhering to the characteristics of professional excellence.  All this is of
                  course makes him an excellent inspirational figure for our students.

                      <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                        Avicenna, a physician from the age of 18, experimented with remedies from Persia, Greece
                        and India to treat his patients often without asking for payment.  He has written about
                        diseases, insomnia, dementia, epilepsy amongst others and corrected Aristotle in the perception
                        that light emanates from the mind through the eyes. He correctly showed that light first
                        enters the eyes from the outside. The translation of his five volume encyclopaedia called
                        Cannon of Medicine into Latin was used by Europeans as a standard textbook up until 1800.
                        In Chemistry, he used steam distillation to produce plant oils such as rose essence which
                        he used for aromatherapy remedies.  In Mechanics, he made a distinction between the inclination
                        (tendency to motion) and force of a projectile, and concluded that motion was a result of an
                        inclination transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that projectile motion in a
                        vacuum would not cease. Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians
                        such as Magnus and Ockham.  Around the 1000 AD, Avicenna was considered as a replacement of
                        Aristotle as the all-round scientist, scholar and philosopher of his time. His ideas on
                        ethics are as valid and appropriate today as they were in 11th century.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Avicenna spent his life in pursuit of knowledge and when his friends asked him to slow down
                        for his health, he famously replied “I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with
                        length”.  He died in June 1037, in his fifty-six year, in the month of Ramadan and was buried
                        in Hamadan, Iran.  In 1980, the then Soviet Union which ruled his birthplace Bukhara,
                        celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna's birth.
